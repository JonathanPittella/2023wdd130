            <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h3>
            <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon
            was
            given
            the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the
            number of
            folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they
            never
            left.
            Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep are
            also
            commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which
            tower
            over
            the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or rain when needed.
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest
            undammed
            rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder
            in
            the
            early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are good rapids all
            summer...but
            families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer
            water more.

                <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
                <p>
                Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the
                Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
                beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip runs
                from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding
                scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human
                activity, and great whitewater opportunities. Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is
                usually done in 6 days desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark. This
                designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.

                <h3>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h3>
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips.
                    You will
                    never
                    forget
                    your visit to the Grand Canyon.
                    Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make
                    one
                    truly
                    unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater
                    rapids, but
                    with side canyons and ancient indian ruins accessible only by river.
                    CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are
                    technically
                    rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances.
                    However,
                    most
                    people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.
