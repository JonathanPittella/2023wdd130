        My degree is in Web and Computer Programming, and my career path is to focus on mastering my skills till I am a professional programmer and web developer. I'm not trying to be a degree owner. I will be a reference for companies, and when they think that they need a specialist in programming and web development, I will be the one they think about, not because I want to be better than someone but because I want to give a better financial condition for my family, I have a little son, he is six months old, I wish to give to him the opportunities that I never thought I could have.

        My favorite hobby is playing video games, but being sincere, I don't play alone now because I play with my little son. Now we play with his cars and his rubber teethers as much as I can. He is too big for his age now he is about 29 pounds. My wife is a wonderful person. I love her, and to be honest, my hobby is changing to being with them and teaching my son, he is progressing fast, and I believe that he will start to talk before he completes one year old. Now he is looking at the computer's screen and making sounds like he would want to speak to me.

        Currently, I'm a supervisor in a supermarket net. I travel weekly for physical attendance audits to help the stores have the utmost products available for sale.
I'm taking the course because I hope to give a better life to my family and to be able to serve as much as I can. One of my objectives is a Home-Office job and be capable of being ready to minister to the brothers and sisters more frequently and teach young women and young boys so they can have good jobs to pay for their missions and build their families and houses.

        I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for ten years. I was baptized on 02/23/2013 when I was sixteen. I served as a missionary in Brazil's Sao Paulo West Mission from 2017 to 2019.
